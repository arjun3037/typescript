Core Types -
    number - All number , no diff between integer and floats
    String - All text value
    boolean - true , false
    object - {age:30}
    array - ['string']
    tuples - added by TypeScript(it is not available in java script). Fixed-array length
    ENUM - enum{NEW,OLD} Added by TS : automaticallyt enumerated global constant identifiers
    Any - assign any type , we should avoid it to use.
==> TypeScripts type system only helps use during development(before the code compiled)
==> JS uses dynamic types (resolved at runtime) but TS uses static types (resolved at development)
==> the core primittive types in TS are all lower case  ex - 'string' and 'number'
==> if we push elements in tuple then TS won't complain about it.
